Act as a senior product designer conducting a rigorous UI and UX review.

Evaluate the attached interface for:

* visual hierarchy
* information architecture
* clarity of labels and controls
* affordances and discoverability
* consistency
* interaction design
* cognitive load
* error prevention and recovery
* accessibility
* responsiveness to likely user intent

For every issue you identify:

* Describe the specific problem.
* Point to the exact UI element or area involved.
* Explain why it could harm usability.
* Rate severity from 1–4: cosmetic, minor, major, critical.
* Recommend a concrete change.

Do not give generic advice such as “simplify the design” or “improve hierarchy.” Base every criticism on observable evidence in the interface.

Finish with the 5 highest-priority improvements ranked by expected user impact.
